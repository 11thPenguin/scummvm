README: Still needs writing

What is Residual:
 Residual is a ScummVM sub-project to create an engine to play the remaining 
 (residual) LucasArts adventures that ScummVM does not support. This means the
 3D titles Grim Fandango (and eventually, maybe, perhaps) Escape from 
 Monkey Island. It's a word pun, as 'grime' is a residue (as is scum). 

How do I run Residual?
 Create ~/.residualrc (UNIX) or C:\residual.ini (Win32)
 Add:
  DataDir=[path to all the .lab files]
  good_times=TRUE

Notes about Residual:
  * Exit with 'q', and don't press f1, as things will go loopy.
  * Won't compile in MSVC (see TODO), but will on MingW32.
  * Windows you must put .exe in the DataDir and set it to '.' in residual.ini,
    Windows-style path slashing isn't parsed yet.
  * See TODO for other stuff
