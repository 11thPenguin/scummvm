Readme - still needs writing.

What is Residual:
 Residual is a ScummVM sub-project to create an engine to play the remaining (residual)
LucasArts adventures that ScummVM does not support. This means the 3D titles Grim Fandango
(and eventually, maybe, perhaps) Escape from Monkey Island. It's a word pun, as 'grime' is
a residue (as is scum). Get over it.


Running:
 Create ~/.residualrc (UNIX) or C:\residual.ini (Win32)
 Add:
  DataDir=[path to all the .lab files]
  good_times=TRUE

Exit with 'q', and don't press f1 or the inventory... as things go a bit weird.

Notes -
  Won't compile in MSVC (see TODO), but will on MingW32. However under
  Windows you must put .exe in the DataDir and set it to '.' in residual.ini
  Windows-style path slashing isn't parsed yet.

  Seems to run in Software GL for several people - need to debug opengl setup/usage and
figure out why. See TODO for other stuff.
