What is Residual?
-----------------
Residual is a ScummVM (http://www.scummvm.org/) sub-project to play LucasArts'
LUA-based 3D adventures, such as Grim Fandango. Residual is an OpenGL program,
and requires a 3D card with working OpenGL support for optimum playability.

A software renderer is also included for machines without hardware OpenGL.

The main ScummVM program can run LucasArts 2D SCUMM adventures (among others).
Residual is named such as it aims to do the same for the residual (remaining) 
games. It is also a word pun, as the engine used in these LUA-based adventure
is called GrimE (as opposed to SCUMM). Grime is a type of residue.

What games does it support?
---------------------------
Residual is a fairly new project and slow developing project, and is still very
much considered alpha. Currently it contains initial support for Grim Fandango.

It is possible, but far from promised, that we can support the other LucasArts
LUA-based title 'Escape from Monkey Island' in the distant future.

How do I run Residual?
----------------------
As Residual is still under heavy development, it is not yet stable, easy
to use, nor complete. Some technical ability is required.

UNIX:
     Create a ~/.residualrc file, containing the following lines:
       DataDir=[path to all the .lab files]
       good_times=TRUE

Win32:
     Copy 'residual.exe' into the directory containing your .lab files, and
create a file in this directory called 'residual.ini'. This file should contain
the lines:
       DataDir=.
       good_times=TRUE

Residual understands command-line options: 
'-zbuffer' enables masking for hardware 3d rendering.
'-showfps' display fps information.
'-soft' switch to software 3d renderering.

It runs really slow when using -zbuffer!
----------------------------------------
A large portion of older cards (Such as 3dfx cards, Radeon 7500 and earlier,
Matrox G4xx series cards, etc) do not have a fast glDrawPixels implementation.

Unix users may be able to achieve playable framerates by using Mesa 5.0 or
above, but people unable to upgrade or Windows users must use software
renderer (-soft).

What is the state of Residual? 
------------------------------- 
Basic gameplay works, including cutscenes. Some of the game is playable,
but many features are either missing or unstable. There is no abilitity
to save/load, etc. Crashes are likely.

Game currently playable to:
	Meche leaves Manny again (Rubacava, Year 2)

Caveats (in order of appearance):
1) Sound track destruction doesn't do quite a good enough job when
   entering the spider web area (sp.set) in the Petrified Forest
2) Video of Copal's death (among other movies) plays at *almost* 2x
   the correct speed, this causes buffer overflows in the audio.
   While hardcoding the speed to the correct value used by the other
   movies works, it is not a good fix and so it is not implemented
3) Sometimes the Demon Beavers get stuck on obstacles - open the 
   menu for a moment and they will correct themselves

What are the default keys?
--------------------------
e,u,p,i    : Examine, Use, Pickup, Inventory
Arrow keys : Movement
Shift      : Hold to run
Enter      : Selects items in inventory, conversation, etc
Escape     : Skips cutscenes, exits certain screens
q          : Exit Dialog Menu
Ctrl + c   : Force Quit (from command-line)

Development/debug keys from the original game
---------------------------------------------
Ctrl + e   : Enter lua string to execute
Ctrl + g   : Jump to set
Ctrl + i   : Toggle walk boxes
Ctrl + l   : Toggle lighting
Ctrl + n   : Display background name
Ctrl + o   : Create a door
Ctrl + p   : Execute patch file
Ctrl + s   : Turn on cursor
Ctrl + u   : Create a new object
Ctrl + v   : print the value of a variable
Alt + n    : Next viewpoint
Apt + p    : Prev viewpoint
Alt + s    : Run lua script
Shift + n  : Next set
Shift + p  : Prev set
Shift + o  : Toggle object names
F3         : Toggle sector editor
Home       : Go to default position in current set
j          : Enter jump number

How do I report bugs?
---------------------
Don't. Residual is very alpha and we KNOW it doesn't work right.

What else should I know?

 The LUA developers, for creating a nice compact script interpreter.
 
 Tim Schafer, for obvious reasons, and everybody else who helped make
 Grim Fandango a brilliant game; and the EMI team for giving it their
 best try.
 
 Bret Mogilefsky, for managing to create a SPUTM-style 3D LUA engine,
 and avoiding the horrible hack it could have been.
