What is Residual?
-----------------
Residual is a ScummVM (http://www.scummvm.org/) sub-project to play LucasArts'
LUA-bassed 3D adventures. The 2D adventures based on the SCUMM-engine can be run
by the main ScummVM software, Residual handles the residual (remaining) games.
It is also a word pun, as the engine used in the first LUA-based adventure was
gamed GrimE, which is a residue. Residual is an OpenGL program, and requirs a
3D card and OpenGL support.

What games does it support?
---------------------------
Residual is a very new project, and still very much in an alpha stage. Currently
it contains some support for Grim Fandango. We hope to later be able to support 
the other LucasArts LUA-based title 'Escape from Monkey Island'.

How do I run Residual?
----------------------
Again, as Residual is still under heavy development, it is not yet stable, easy
to use, nor complete. However, if you do wish to try it you can do so by:

UNIX:
     Create a ~/.residualrc file, containing the following lines:
       DataDir=[path to all the .lab files]
       good_times=TRUE

Win32:
     Copy 'residual.exe' into the directory containing your .lab files, and
create a file in this directory called 'residual.ini'. This file should contain
the lines:
       DataDir=.
       good_times=TRUE

Residual understands two options: '-zbuffer' which enables masking, and '-screenblocks'
which is a (currently broken) attempt to speed up masking on older cards.

It runs really slow when using -zbuffer!
----------------------------------------
A large portion of older cards (Such as 3dfx cards, Radeon 7500 and earlier,
Matrox G4xx series cards, etc) do not have a fast glDrawPixels implementation.
Unix users can achieve a usable speed by using Mesa 5.0 or newer, but people
unable to upgrade or Windows users are stuck.

We do have a possible solution (-screenblocks), however it is experimental
untested, and currently will thrash memory and potentially crash.

What is the state of Residual? 
------------------------------- 
Many features are not yet supported. 2D graphics are not yet drawn, nor do we
use the built-in fonts. You can, however, still interact with objects that are
not drawn (such as the mail tube). It may crash. You can walk off the screen and
into places you should not be able to. There is no lighting.

The game itself is in a fairly decent state, and you can play at least up until
you retrieve your first customer. The default Grim keys 
use, 'p' to pickup and 'i' for inventory) will let you interact with things and
actually 'play' it.

What are the default keys?
--------------------------
Arrow keys : Movement
e,u,p,i    : Examine, Use, Pickup, Inventory
Shift      : Hold while moving, to 'Run'
Enter      : Selects items in inventory, conversation, etc
Escape     : Exits out of some screens
q          : Quit 

How do I report bugs?
---------------------
See above. There is no point yet.

What else should I know?
------------------------
  * Exit with 'q', and don't press f1, as things will go loopy.
  * Won't compile in MSVC (see TODO), but will on MingW32
  * See TODO for other stuff

Special Thanks To:
------------------ 
 The LUA developers, for creating a nice compact script interpreter.
 
 Tim Schafer, for obvious reasons, and everybody else who helped make
 Grim Fandango a brilliant game; and the EMI team for giving it their
 best try.
 
 Bret Mogilefsky, for managing to create a SPUTM-style 3D LUA engine,
 and avoiding the horrible hack it could have been.
