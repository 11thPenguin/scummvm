--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Residual?
-----------------
Residual is a ScummVM (http://www.scummvm.org/) sub-project to play LucasArts'
LUA-bassed 3D adventures. The 2D adventures based on the SCUMM-engine can be run
by the main ScummVM software, Residual handles the residual (remaining) games.
It is also a word pun, as the engine used in the first LUA-based adventure was
gamed GrimE, which is a residue. Residual is an OpenGL program, and requirs a
3D card and OpenGL support.

What games does it support?
---------------------------
Residual is a very new project, and still very much in an alpha stage. Currently
it contains some support for Grim Fandango. We hope to later be able to support 
the other LucasArts LUA-based title 'Escape from Monkey Island'.

How do I run Residual?
----------------------
Again, as Residual is still under heavy development, it is not yet stable, easy
to use, nor complete. However, if you do wish to try it you can do so by:

UNIX:
     Create a ~/.residualrc file, containing the following lines:
       DataDir=[path to all the .lab files]
       good_times=TRUE
Win32:
     Copy 'residual.exe' into the directory containing your .lab files, and
create a file in this directory called 'residual.ini'. This file should contain
the lines:
       DataDir=.
       good_times=TRUE

What is the state of Residual?
-------------------------------
Many features are not yet supported. 2D graphics and text are not yet drawn,
although you can interact with objects that do not appear (eg, the mail tube)
It may crash. There is no kind of zbuffering, so Manny is always 'in front'
of objects. You can walk off the screen and into places you should not be
able to. There is no lighting. Basically, not all that great.

However, the game itself is in a fairly decent state. You can (using the
default Grim keys, such as 'e' for examine, 'u' to use, 'p' to pickup and
'i' for inventory) interact with things and actually 'play' it.

How do I report bugs?
---------------------
See above. There is no point yet.

What else should I know?
------------------------
  * Exit with 'q', and don't press f1, as things will go loopy.
  * Won't compile in MSVC (see TODO), but will on MingW32.
  * See TODO for other stuff

Special Thanks To:
------------------ 
 The LUA developers, for creating a nice compact script interpreter.
 
 Tim Schafer, for obvious reasons, and everybody else who helped make
 Grim Fandango a brilliant game; and the EMI team for giving it their
 best try.
 
 Bret Mogilefsky, for managing to create a SPUTM-style 3D LUA engine,
 and avoiding the horrible mess it could have been.
