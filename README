What is Residual?
-----------------
Residual is a ScummVM (http://www.scummvm.org/) sub-project to play LucasArts'
LUA-bassed 3D adventures, such as Grim Fandango. Residual is an OpenGL program,
and requires a 3D card with working OpenGL support.

The main ScummVM program can run LucasArts 2D SCUMM adventures (among others).
Residual is named such as it aims to do the same for the residual (remaining) 
games. It is also a word pun, as the engine used in these LUA-based adventure
is called GrimE (as opposed to SCUMM). Grime is a type of residue.

What games does it support?
---------------------------
Residual is a fairly new project and slow developing project, and is still very
much considered alpha. Currently it contains initial support for Grim Fandango.

It is possible, but far from promised, that we can support the other LucasArts
LUA-based title 'Escape from Monkey Island' in the distant future.

How do I run Residual?
----------------------
As Residual is still under heavy development, it is not yet stable, easy
to use, nor complete. Some technical ability is required.

UNIX:
     Create a ~/.residualrc file, containing the following lines:
       DataDir=[path to all the .lab files]
       good_times=TRUE

Win32:
     Copy 'residual.exe' into the directory containing your .lab files, and
create a file in this directory called 'residual.ini'. This file should contain
the lines:
       DataDir=.
       good_times=TRUE

Residual understands two command-line options: '-zbuffer' which enables masking
and '-screenblocks' which is a (currently broken) attempt to speed up masking
on older cards.

It runs really slow when using -zbuffer!
----------------------------------------
A large portion of older cards (Such as 3dfx cards, Radeon 7500 and earlier,
Matrox G4xx series cards, etc) do not have a fast glDrawPixels implementation.

Unix users may be able to achieve playable framerates by using Mesa 5.0 or
above, but people unable to upgrade or Windows users are stuck. We do have a
possible solution (-screenblocks), however it is experimental, untested, and
currently will thrash memory and crash.

What is the state of Residual? 
------------------------------- 
Many features are not yet supported. Cutscenes work, you can interact with
objects (even if they are invisible, like the mail tube!) and play at least a
portion of the game.

HOWEVER: It may crash. There is no lighting, text, some actor animations are 
missing, and 2D objects are not drawn. Walking is pretty broken and you can get
stuck frequently.

What are the default keys?
--------------------------
e,u,p,i    : Examine, Use, Pickup, Inventory
Arrow keys : Movement
Shift      : Hold to run
Enter      : Selects items in inventory, conversation, etc
Escape     : Skips cutscenes, exits certain screens
q          : Quit 

How do I report bugs?
---------------------
Don't. Residual is very alpha and we KNOW it doesn't work right.

What else should I know?
------------------------
  * Exit with 'q', and don't press f1, as things will go loopy.
  * See TODO for other stuff

Special Thanks To:
------------------ 
 The LUA developers, for creating a nice compact script interpreter.
 
 Tim Schafer, for obvious reasons, and everybody else who helped make
 Grim Fandango a brilliant game; and the EMI team for giving it their
 best try.
 
 Bret Mogilefsky, for managing to create a SPUTM-style 3D LUA engine,
 and avoiding the horrible hack it could have been.
