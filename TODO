Residual TODO list (in rough order of priority):
------------------------------------------------
 * Work out why Residual uses 80+% CPU!
 * Check OpenGL usage on Windows (Room backgrounds look like shit, specks everywhere)
 * Remove hash_map usage (not implemented on Visual Studio & other compilers)
 * Remove as much other STL stuff as possible (see above)
 * Implement walkboxes and related functions (MakeSectorActive/GetActorSector/isActorInSector, etc)
 * Z-Planes (translate ZBitmap data into OpenGL format?)
 * Implement text fonts and other primitives
 * Check sound decoder - it clips.. possible uint vs int casting issue, perhaps?
 * Add OpenGL lighting
 * Add SMUSH (aquadran is looking, Grim seems to uses CMI codecs + 2 new ones)
 * Proper vsscanf implementation in textsplit.cpp for platforms without it (many!)
 * Cross platform GUI for debug input dialogs (ctrl+e ctrl+g etc) original used MFC

MSVC notes:
 These things need doing (At least) for it to be compilable under MSVC..
 Get rid of stdint.h include when using MSVC
 Get rid of hash_map usage (not supported in MSVC)
 Add global include of Windows.h 
 Add global definitions of:
	#define strcasecmp stricmp
	#define M_PI 3.14159265
        typedef unsigned char byte;^M
        typedef unsigned char uint8_t;^M
        typedef unsigned short uint16_t;^M
        typedef unsigned long uint32_t;^M
        typedef unsigned int uint_t;^M
        typedef signed char int8_t;^M
        typedef signed short int16_t;^M
        typedef signed long int32_t;^M
 Do something about the i386 ifdef around bits.hh's get_float
 GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5 in bitmap.cc does not exist in MSVC
 round() function in lua.cpp's check_int does not exist in MSVC
 vsscanf function does not exist in MSVC (already worked around)
 dirent stuff in resource.cpp needs to use Win32 API equivs (eg, findFirstFile etc)
