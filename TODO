Residual in-progress items (in rough order of priority):
--------------------------------------------------------
 * Figure out why SMUSH doesn't display graphics on Windows
 * Get SMUSH to stream from .lab instead of needing uncompressed snm
 * Add LAF font support to replace existing hack

Residual TODO list (in rough order of priority):
------------------------------------------------ 
 * Bounds check the Screenblocks dirty rectangle stuff, so it stops trashing
   memory and making Residual unusable/unstable.
 * Implement 2D primitives 
 * Add OpenGL lighting
 * Implement iMuse
 * Proper vsscanf implementation in textsplit.cpp for platforms without it (many!)
 * Cross platform GUI for debug input dialogs (ctrl+e ctrl+g etc) original used MFC

MSVC notes:
 These things need doing (At least) for it to be compilable under MSVC..
 round() function in lua.cpp's check_int does not exist in MSVC
 vsscanf function does not exist in MSVC (already worked around)
