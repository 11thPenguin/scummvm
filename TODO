Residual TODO list (in rough order of priority):
------------------------------------------------
 * This assert frequently triggers when escaping SMUSH cutscenes. Why?
     residual: timer.cpp:91: int Timer::handler(int): Assertion
               `_timerSlots[l].procedure && _timerSlots[l].interval > 0' failed.
 * Figure out why in-memory decompression of SMUSH movies doesn't work
   (See #define in smush.h)
 * Add LAF font support to replace existing hack 
 * Bounds check the Screenblocks dirty rectangle stuff, so it stops trashing
   memory and making Residual unusable/unstable.	
 * Implement bitmap costume drawing
 * Implement 2D primitives 
 * Save/Load support
 * Implement rendering of odd-sized 'overlay'(?) SMUSH animations, such as mo_ts
   at the beginning of the first scene
 * Add OpenGL lighting
 * Implement iMuse
 * Proper vsscanf implementation in textsplit.cpp for platforms without it (MSVC, etc)
 * Cross platform GUI for debug input dialogs (ctrl+e ctrl+g etc) - original used MFC

MSVC notes:
 round() function in lua.cpp's check_int does not exist in MSVC.
