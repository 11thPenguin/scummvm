List of fixed bug in GF scripts:

+Various bugs
	-Issues with CD check:
	The CD check function doesn't work correctly, so we skip it.

	-Fix the behaviour of dofile statement
	In _system.lua there is a re-definition of dofile, used to load
	scripts from some others positions ("Scripts\" and "d:\\grimFandango\\Scripts\\").
	This cause a lot of warnings when an non-existent file is required.
	Moreover this function is bugged: it always returns nil, even if the
	file has correctly loaded. So it's has been modified to load scripts
	only from the main path and it returns nil when the file has
	successfully loaded, otherwise the number one (which is a boolean
	true). The last modification is required, since the others scripts
	expect this behavior.

	-Fix bug #312 "Manny disappears while holding and examining the sign the Ruba."
	In sg and na sets, if Manny examine the sign of Ruba, it zoom the
	visual near the sign, by changing the setup and putting Manny and the
	sign in it. The code that translate the coordinates of Manny is
	bugged, since it doesn't distinguish the case when the sign is
	planted or not; in particular, it's right when it's planted. This
	patch add a check of state of sign, and set Manny in a fixed position
	(in the centre of the scene) when he is holding the sign. It also
	corrects the behaviour of Manny's head, since he doesn't look at the
	sign, when he is examining it. This is caused by the lacks of
	"enable_head_control(FALSE/TRUE)" before and after
	"START/END_CUT_SCENE()" and by a call at "manny:head_look_at_point"
	with the wrong arguments (a table instead of the coordinates instead
	of single coordinates).

+Untriggered contents:
	-Fix the missing dialogue with Domino at third year
	In dlg_dom2.lua, the argument of CheckFirstTime is wrong; this
	prevents the correct load of this script.

Contents of residualvm-grim-patches.lab and its rebuild:

residualvm-grim-patches.lab contains all .patchr files in dists/engine-data/patches/grim/ directory.
If you add a new patch in that directory, you have to update this file with a detailed
description of what that patch does.
Then you have to rebuild residualvm-grim-patches.lab with mklab from residualvm-tools repo.
The rebuild command is (assuming that you are launching it in dists/engine-data/):

mklab --grim patches/grim residualvm-grim-patch.lab

Please check that there aren't any files different from .patchr inside that directory before the rebuild,
so delete all junk, backup and system files, like namepatch.patchr~, namepatch.patchr.bak, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db and so on.
