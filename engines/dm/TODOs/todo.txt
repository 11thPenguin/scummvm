Bugs:
	Display:
		Spellcasting tabs are displayed inproperly, switching between them is possible tho
		Cursor icons are drawn twice

	Logic:
		Items thrown on the right side end up on the left side 
		Can't place torch in player's hand after loading, can do so only after brining up the inventory
		Restarting the game after the party is dead segfaults

Todo:
	Add wiki entry for DM
	
	Double check enums with hex literals
	Double check strcat, strstr usages
	I forgot to add a bunch of warning for show/hide mouse pointer and other mouse functions

Code stuff todo:
	Complete stub methods(blitShrink, blitmask)
	Add proper save header, add error handling to it
	Add translations to f433_processCommand140_saveGame 'LOAD'
