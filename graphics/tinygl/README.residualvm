This is a modified version of TinyGL 0.4 intended for use with ResidualVM.
The changes made from the original version of TinyGL 0.4 are:

* Changed file extensions from *.c to *.cpp to compile as C++.
* Included only files needed by ResidualVM.
* Changed include paths in source files.
* Added needed type casts and fixes for proper compile.
* Added 't/T' prefix to prevent OpenGL name clashes.
* Added light shading texture mapping mode.
* Removed unneeded code.
* Introduced second 32-bit z-buffer for 3d objects only,
  and kept 16-bit only for static z-buffer bitmaps.
* Added support for drawing in shadow mode (generate mask and polygon shadow).
