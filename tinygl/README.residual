This is a modified version of TinyGL 0.4 intended for use with Residual.
The changes made from the original version of TinyGL 0.4 are:

* Changed files extensions from *.c to *.cpp to compile as C++.
* Included only files needed by Residual.
* Changed includes paths in source files.
* Added needed type cast after malloc funcs and one fix for proper
   compile.
* Added 't/T' prefix to prevent OpenGl names duplication.
